[Proposal]()

# 31/10/2019

Data received. Done some preliminary analysis. Meeting with Sarah. What to do:

- linear model of death proportion as a function of age
- do it separately for BC deaths vs other outcome, other deaths vs other outcome
- do it separately for symptomatic and screened
- remove diagnostic "other"

# 1/11/2019

Working on the document. Doing proportion time-courses. This seems to give convincing results.

# 15/11/2019 

Over 71 data, better plots, timelines.

# 25/22/2019

Created publication-quality figures. Still, need data for the assessment figure.
