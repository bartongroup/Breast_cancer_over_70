[Proposal]()

# 31/10/2019

Data received. Done some preliminary analysis. Meeting with Sarah. What to do:

- linear model of death proportion as a function of age
- do it separately for BC deaths vs other outcome, other deaths vs other outcome
- do it separately for symptomatic and screened
- remove diagnostic "other"
